# Temporary TypeScript Fix

The project currently has deep TypeScript type conflicts that require systematic fixing. Here's what's happening:

## Core Issues:
1. **Type instantiation excessively deep** - Circular type references in lead/database types
2. **Missing database properties** - LeadWithRelations vs actual database schema mismatch  
3. **React import conflicts** - allowSyntheticDefaultImports issues
4. **Database function/table mismatches** - Missing SMTP settings, functions

## Temporary Solutions Applied:
1. Created debug helpers in `src/components/debug/DisableProblematicComponents.tsx`
2. Using `any` types temporarily in problematic components
3. Added type assertion helpers

## To Properly Fix:
1. Regenerate Supabase types after ensuring database schema is correct
2. Create separate UI types vs database types
3. Fix circular imports between types
4. Enable proper React synthetic imports

## Next Steps:
- Focus on core functionality first
- Fix types incrementally
- Consider using strict: false temporarily in development

The app should work functionally even with these type warnings.
